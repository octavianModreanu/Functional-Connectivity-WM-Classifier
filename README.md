This is a group project for Neuromatch Academy's Computational Neuroscience Course

The project is built around the HCP WM dataset and successfully distinguishes WM load in 0 back vs 2 back task.

We have used an SVM classifier using correlation matrices of between and within networks as feature
vectors to capture the functional connectivity differences in working memory load in 0-back vs 2-back tasks.
